    // You're going to re-implement this code using React!
    // 💣 So go ahead and delete this implementation (or comment it out for now)
    // These three lines are similar to React.createElement
    // const element = document.createElement('div')
    // element.textContent = 'Hello World' // 💰 in React, you set this with the "children" prop
    // element.className = 'container' // 💰 in React, this is also called the "className" prop
    // This is similar to ReactDOM.render
    // rootElement.append(element)

    // 🐨 Please re-implement the regular document.createElement code above
    // with these React API calls
    // 💰 The example in the markdown file should be a good hint for you.

    Combine this frustration with the bastardization of the actual word “declarative” to
    basically just mean “good” and all of a sudden your imposter syndrome is tap dancing
    on your confidence, and you realize you don’t even like programming that much.
